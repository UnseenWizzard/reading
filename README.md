My collected reading lists, reading recomendations, etc

## Books 
### Foundations 
* Introduction to Aglorithms 
  * aka CLRS Algorithms
  * _the_ algorithms book, personal favorite
* Algorithms - Robert Sedgewick
  * easier read than CLRS, some more standard/straightforward solutions than CLRS
* Structure And Interpretation of Computer Programs
  * https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html 
### Development
* The Pragmatic Programmer
* Uncle Bob's Clean XY Series
  * Clean Code, Clean Coder, Clean Architecture, Clean Agile
  * Like all "here's how to do things" books, take with a grain of salt and don't take ideas and opinions as religion
  * Clean Agile actually put's that into perspective nicely, making very clear it's part memoire, part personal opinion 
* Refactoring - Martin Fowler
  * https://refactoring.com/
  * All of Marting Fowler's website & talks are worth a look
  * Nice descriptions of architecture and design patterns also
